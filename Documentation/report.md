# Project Report: Simplified Stock Market Predictor AI

## Introduction
The Simplified Stock Market Predictor AI project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts stock prices based on historical data. By utilizing various technical indicators and machine learning algorithms, this project seeks to provide insights into stock market trends and assist users in making informed investment decisions.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
   - A publicly available dataset containing historical stock prices was utilized. The data was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and normalize the values for better model performance.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Technical indicators such as moving averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) were calculated to create features that would be used in the machine learning model.

3. **Model Development:**
   - A simple machine learning model, specifically linear regression, was chosen for this project. The model was trained using the preprocessed data and the extracted features.

4. **Prediction and Evaluation:**
   - The trained model was used to predict stock prices on new data. The performance of the model was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

5. **Visualization:**
   - Visualizations were created to compare the actual stock prices with the predicted prices, providing a clear representation of the model's performance.

## Results
The model demonstrated a reasonable level of accuracy in predicting stock prices, with the evaluation metrics indicating satisfactory performance. The visualizations highlighted the correlation between the predicted and actual prices, showcasing the model's effectiveness.

## Conclusions
The Simplified Stock Market Predictor AI project successfully implemented a machine learning approach to predict stock prices using historical data and technical indicators. Future work could involve exploring more complex models and incorporating additional features to enhance prediction accuracy.
