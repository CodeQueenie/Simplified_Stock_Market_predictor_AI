## Purpose
The sandbox folder is a safe space for experimenting and testing new features, debugging issues, or trying alternative implementations without affecting the main project.

## Structure
- `test_data_cleaning.py`: For testing the data cleaning pipeline.
- `test_feature_extraction.py`: For experimenting with feature extraction methods.
- `test_model_development.py`: For testing model training or alternative algorithms.
- `test_prediction_evaluation.py`: For evaluating new prediction techniques.
- `test_visualization.py`: For debugging or enhancing visualization.

## Note
The scripts in this folder are for testing purposes only and may not represent finalized or production-ready code.
